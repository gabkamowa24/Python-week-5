Assignment Submission: Python OOP & Polymorphism
üìå Overview

This project contains solutions to two activities:

Assignment 1: Creating a custom House class with attributes, methods, constructors, and inheritance.

Activity 2: Demonstrating polymorphism using different vehicle classes with the same method name but different behaviors.

üè† Assignment 1: House Class
What it does:

Defines a House class with attributes (address, num_rooms, color).

Methods include:

describe(): Returns a summary of the house.

paint(new_color): Changes the house‚Äôs color.

Uses constructor __init__ to initialize each object with unique values.

Inheritance:

A subclass SmartHouse extends House.

Adds an attribute wifi_enabled.

Overrides the describe() method to include smart features (example of polymorphism).
Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
What it does:

Defines a base class Vehicle with a move() method.

Subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat) each override move() with their own behavior.

Demonstrates polymorphism: the same method name produces different outputs depending on the object.

Key Concepts Demonstrated

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Attributes and Methods

Constructors (__init__)

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Encapsulation principles (restricting data to class methods)
